    "\n",
    "This Season Image Classifier CNN project is a continuation of my previous Season Image Classifier that attempted to perform basic feature extraction such as colors from different images and try to classify them as being of one of the four seasons. It was originally inspired by a Day and Night Image Classifier project as part of [Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of [280] RGB color images split into two directories and four categories each (spring, summer, fall, and winter):\n",
    "\n",
    "    img_train: 200 images for training (50 of each season)\n",
    "    img_test: 80 images for testing (20 of each season)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The goal of this project is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can classify and accurately label images based on the season in which they were taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: I have received access to the [AMOS dataset](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/datasets/amos/) (Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes), but I haven't had time to properly label all the data yet, so I'm using CC0 images collected from [Pexels](https://pexels.com).*"
